# Lutepad

This is a small clone of the Windows text editor Notepad written in C++ and Qt4.

Compiled fine in January under Ubuntu 13.10, but may have been broken by Qt updates since then.

Originally built for the 2014 J-Term class "C++ and the Linux Environment" at [Pacific Lutheran University](http://www.plu.edu/csce).
